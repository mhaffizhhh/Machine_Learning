# Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains a project focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. UCB is a popular approach in bandit problems, where the goal is to balance exploration and exploitation to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Project Overview
The UCB algorithm is an effective method for solving multi-armed bandit problems, where an agent must choose between different actions (or "arms") with uncertain rewards. This project demonstrates how UCB can be applied to select the optimal action while minimizing regret over time, [source dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaandsheikh/upper-confidence-bound-dataset).

# Car Price Prediction using Regression
This repository contains a project focused on predicting car prices using various regression techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on its features.

## Project Overview
Car price prediction is a common use case in the automotive industry and helps in making informed decisions for both buyers and sellers. This project leverages machine learning regression algorithms to analyze and predict car prices.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that influence car prices.
- Model Training: Training several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics R-squared.

## Result
The results can be seen in [ML_Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/mhaffizhhh/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Regression/Car%20Price%20Prediction/ML_Regression.ipynb) with Random Forest having the largest R-Squared value.

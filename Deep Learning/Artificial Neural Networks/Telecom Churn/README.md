# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The project utilizes customer data to identify patterns and predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service.

## Project Structure

- **Telecom_Churn.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the complete implementation of the ANN model for predicting customer churn. This notebook covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python installed, along with several essential libraries. The main libraries used in this project include:

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The ANN model predicts whether a customer will churn based on various features provided in the dataset. Model performance is assessed using metrics accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project illustrates how ANN can be effectively applied to solve a classification problem in the telecom industry by predicting customer churn. It highlights the process from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and potential churn risks.

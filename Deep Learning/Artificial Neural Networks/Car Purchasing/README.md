# Car Purchasing Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project demonstrates how to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict car purchasing amounts based on various customer features. The dataset includes information about customer income, age, and other attributes, which are used to predict the purchasing capacity.

## Project Structure

- **Car_Purchasing.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the full implementation of the ANN model for predicting car purchases. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you'll need to have Python installed, along with several libraries. The primary libraries used in this project are:

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit Learn

## Results
The model is designed to predict the car purchasing amount based on the input features provided. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Conclusion
This project shows how an ANN can be applied to a regression problem in predicting car purchasing amounts. It demonstrates the process from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a comprehensive example of using machine learning in a real-world scenario.

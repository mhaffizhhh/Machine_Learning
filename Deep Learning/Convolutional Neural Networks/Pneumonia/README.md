# Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains a project that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained to distinguish between images showing healthy lungs and those affected by pneumonia.

## Project Structure

- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets): Dataset of chest X-ray images.
- **Pneumonia.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the CNN model, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of chest X-ray images divided into two categories:

1. **Normal**: X-ray images of healthy lungs.
2. **Pneumonia**: X-ray images of lungs affected by pneumonia.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need to install Python along with several libraries. The primary libraries used in this project include:

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The CNN model is trained to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia-affected. The performance of the model is evaluated primarily using the accuracy metric. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide through the entire process, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in medical imaging, specifically for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It serves as a practical example of how deep learning can be applied to real-world healthcare challenges.

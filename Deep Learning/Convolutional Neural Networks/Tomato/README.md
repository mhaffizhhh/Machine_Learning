# Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify diseases in tomato leaves. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the [Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf).

## Project Structure

- **Dataset**: The dataset of tomato leaf images.
- **Tomato_Leaf_Disease_Detection.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the CNN model, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset contains images of tomato leaves categorized into several classes based on different types of diseases, as well as healthy leaves. The classes include:

- **Healthy**
- **Tomato Mosaic Virus**
- **Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus**
- **Bacterial Spot**
- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**
- **Leaf Mold**
- **Septoria Leaf Spot**
- **Spider Mites**
- **Target Spot**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need Python installed along with several essential libraries. The primary libraries used in this project include:

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The CNN model is trained to classify tomato leaves into different disease categories or identify them as healthy. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks in the field of agriculture, specifically for detecting diseases in tomato plants. It provides a practical example of how deep learning can be utilized to support plant disease diagnosis and potentially assist farmers in making informed decisions.

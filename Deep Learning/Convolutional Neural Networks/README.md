# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Projects

This repository contains implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applied to different image classification tasks. Each subfolder within this directory showcases a distinct application of CNN in detecting specific conditions or objects from images.

## Folder Structure

- `Pneumonia`: Contains the project for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using CNN.
- `Tomato`: Contains the project for detecting diseases in tomato leaves using CNN.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebooks, you will need Python installed along with several essential libraries. The primary libraries used across these projects include:

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Projects Overview
### Pneumonia Detection
- Folder: pneumonia/
- Description: This project applies a CNN model to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia-affected. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled X-ray images and evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.
### Tomato Leaf Disease Detection
- Folder: tomato/
- Description: This project uses a CNN model to identify and classify diseases in tomato leaves. The dataset consists of images of tomato leaves labeled with different disease categories. The model is designed to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves.

## Conclusion
These projects demonstrate the versatility and power of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in tackling various image classification tasks, from medical imaging to agricultural diagnostics. Each project provides a comprehensive guide through the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation process.

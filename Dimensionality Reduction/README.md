# Dimensionality Reduction
This folder contains various techniques for dimensionality reduction and aims to evaluate which technique offers the best performance in terms of accuracy metrics.

## Folder Structure

- **Principal Component Analysis**: Implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis**: Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction.
- **Kernel Principal Component Analysis**: Implementation of Kernel PCA, a non-linear form of PCA, for dimensionality reduction.


## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to compare different dimensionality reduction techniques and determine which method provides the best performance according to specific accuracy metrics. These techniques are essential when dealing with high-dimensional datasets to reduce computational complexity and enhance model performance.

## Results
Once you have run all the notebooks, consolidate the findings by comparing the accuracy metrics. The best dimensionality reduction technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset used, such as the distribution of the data, the presence of non-linear relationships, and the ultimate goal of the analysis.

## Conclusion
Use the results from this folder to make an informed decision about which dimensionality reduction technique to use in your future machine learning or data analysis projects.

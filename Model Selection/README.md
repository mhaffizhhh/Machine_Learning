# Machine Learning Model Evaluation and Tuning
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key techniques for evaluating and tuning machine learning models. The focus is on two essential methodologies: K-Fold Cross Validation and Grid Search.

## Techniques Covered
**1. K-Fold Cross Validation**:

A robust technique for evaluating model performance by dividing the dataset into k subsets and training the model k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining subsets as the training set.


**2. Grid Search**:

An exhaustive search method to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model by systematically testing different parameter values.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for implementing and understanding two critical aspects of machine learning: model evaluation with K-Fold Cross Validation and hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search. By using these techniques, you can improve the reliability and performance of your machine learning models.

# K-Fold Cross Validation Example
This repository contains an implementation of K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate a machine learning model using the Raisin Dataset. The notebook demonstrates the process of importing data, preprocessing it, and applying K-Fold Cross Validation to ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of data.

## Project Structure
- **k_fold_cross_validation.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations for the implementation of K-Fold Cross Validation.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Raisin Dataset, which contains features describing the physical characteristics of raisins. The dataset is loaded from an Excel file named **Raisin_Dataset.xlsx**.

## Conclusion
This notebook serves as a basic example of how to implement K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It provides insights into how different subsets of data can affect model performance and helps in building more generalizable models.

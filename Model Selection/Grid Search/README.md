# Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters for a machine learning model using the Raisin Dataset.

## Project Structure
- **grid_search.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that includes the code for performing Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.


## Dataset
The dataset used is the Raisin Dataset, which includes features describing the physical characteristics of raisins. The dataset is loaded from an Excel file named **Raisin_Dataset.xlsx**.

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a clear example of how to implement Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. It is an essential technique to ensure that your machine learning model is performing at its best by systematically testing different hyperparameter values.

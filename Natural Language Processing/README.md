# NLP - Spam Email/SMS Prediction
This folder contains a project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for predicting spam in emails or SMS messages. The project utilizes the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, a powerful Python package for processing text data.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify messages as either "spam" or "not spam." The model is trained on a dataset of labeled email/SMS messages and uses various NLP techniques to process and analyze the text data.

## Key Features
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and other preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the text data.
- Feature Extraction: Techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) used to convert text into numerical features.
- Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms are tested and evaluated to find the best-performing model for spam detection.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using metrics accuracy.

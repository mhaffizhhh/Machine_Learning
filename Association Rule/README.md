# Association Rule
This repository contains a project focused on association rule mining, a popular technique in data mining used to discover interesting relationships, patterns, and associations within large datasets.

## Project Overview
Association rule mining is commonly used in market basket analysis to identify products that frequently co-occur in transactions. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful rules that can be used for decision-making, recommendations, or to gain insights into the data.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data into the appropriate format for association rule mining.
- Frequent Itemset Generation: Using algorithms like Apriori to generate frequent itemsets from the dataset.
- Rule Generation: Extracting association rules from the frequent itemsets based on metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
- Evaluation: Analyzing the quality and relevance of the generated rules to ensure they provide valuable insights.

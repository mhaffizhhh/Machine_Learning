# Raisin

## About Dataset
The [Raisin_Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/mhaffizhhh/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Classification/Raisin/Raisin_Dataset.xlsx) is a compilation of data about raisins. The primary objective is to develop a model that can classify raisins into appropriate categories based on the given features. Additionally, I will explore which algorithm is best suited for classifying raisins using the existing features. [Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/850/raisin).

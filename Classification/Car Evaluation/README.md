# Car Evaluation

## About Dataset
The [car_data.csv](https://github.com/mhaffizhhh/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Classification/Car%20Evaluation/car_data.csv) dataset is a collection of data assessing car quality based on several criteria. The main goal is to build a classification model that can evaluate and categorize cars into one of four predefined categories. Additionally, I will look for the most suitable algorithm for classifying cars based on the existing features. [Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation).

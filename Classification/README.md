# Classification Model Selection
This repository contains a project focused on selecting the best classification model based on accuracy. The dataset is trained across various classification models, and the model with the highest accuracy is chosen for final predictions.

## Project Overview
Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes. This project explores multiple classification algorithms to identify the one that performs best on the given dataset.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Model Training: The dataset is trained using various classification algorithms, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model Evaluation: Each model is evaluated using accuracy, and the model with the highest accuracy is selected.

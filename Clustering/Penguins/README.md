# ML Clustering Analysis
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on clustering analysis using various algorithms. The notebook **ML_Clustering_1.ipynb** includes data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of clustering algorithms such as K-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering.

## Project Overview
This project explores clustering techniques to group similar data points in a dataset. The following steps are covered in the notebook:

**1. Data Preprocessing**:

The dataset is loaded and preprocessed for clustering. This includes handling missing values, normalizing the data, and selecting features for clustering.

**2. Elbow Method for K-Means**:

The Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-Means algorithm. The plot visualizes the Within-Cluster Sum of Square (WCSS) to identify the best number of clusters.

**3. K-Means Clustering**:

The K-Means algorithm is implemented to partition the data into clusters. The results are visualized using scatter plots, highlighting the different clusters.

**4. Hierarchical Clustering**:

Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering is applied to the dataset. A dendrogram is used to decide the number of clusters, and the final clusters are visualized.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations of the clustering results for each algorithm, providing insights into the data's underlying structure. The analysis helps in understanding how different clustering techniques perform on the same dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various clustering techniques in machine learning. Each algorithm has its strengths and is suitable for different types of data. The choice of algorithm and the number of clusters can significantly impact the results.
